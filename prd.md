🧠 PRD: Personalized Task Manager
📌 Title
SmartTaskly — A Personalized Task Manager That Optimizes Scheduling and Prioritization Using AI

🧭 1. Executive Summary
SmartTaskly is a personalized task management platform that intelligently prioritizes and schedules tasks based on user habits, preferences, workload, energy levels, and deadlines. The product leverages AI to learn from user behavior and continuously improve task recommendations, scheduling, and reminders.

🎯 2. Problem Statement
Most task management tools follow a rigid approach—users must manually prioritize tasks without considering context like personal routines, historical productivity patterns, or real-time constraints. This leads to burnout, missed deadlines, and reduced productivity.

🌈 3. Product Vision
To empower users with a task manager that feels like an intelligent assistant—one that understands how and when they work best, adapts in real-time, and helps them maintain momentum without overwhelm.
